Social wasps from the *Vespula* genus have spread throughout the world from their native ranges, and their eusocial population structure has enabled them to reach high abundance and disrupt ecosystems in their invasive ranges.
For example, common wasps (*Vespula vulgaris*) and German wasps (*Vespula germanica*) are a major problem in beech forests in New Zealand, where they are competitors and predators of native fauna.
Social wasps are also one of the four hymenopteran lineages to independently evolve eusociality.

We used *de novo*, second-generation sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding to construct reference-quality genome assemblies for *V. vulgaris*, *V. germanica* and the western yellowjacket *Vespula pensylvanica*.
We assembled between 176 Mb and 179 Mb in 25 linked chromosomes for each genome, with 10–200 unanchored scaffolds.
We used computational annotation to predict 15–18 thousand putative genes per species, followed by manual curation and comparative analysis of gene sets associated with eusociality, aggression, development, venom and pesticide metabolism.

The genes we have identified, involved in developmental processes like sperm production, may be targets for next-generation eradication efforts such as gene drives.
